Powerpipe is **dashboards and benchmarks as code**. Use it to visualize any data source, and run compliance benchmarks and controls, for effective decision-making and ongoing compliance monitoring.

**Benchmarks** - [5,000+ open-source controls](https://hub.powerpipe.io) from CIS, NIST, PCI, HIPAA, FedRamp and more. [Run instantly on your machine](https://powerpipe.io/docs#run-security-and-compliance-benchmarks) or as part of your deployment pipeline.

**Relationship Diagrams** - The only dashboarding tool designed from the ground up to [visualize DevOps data](https://powerpipe.io/docs#visualize-cloud-infrastructure). Explore your cloud, understand relationships, drill down to the details.

**Dashboards & Reports** - High-level dashboards provide a quick overview. Use them to highlight misconfigurations and hotspots. [Filter](https://powerpipe.io/docs/run/benchmark/benchmark-dashboard#filtering--grouping), pivot, and [snapshot](https://powerpipe.io/docs/run/snapshots) results.

**Code, not clicks** - Our dashboards are [code](https://powerpipe.io/docs/powerpipe-hcl): version-controlled, composable, shareable, easy to edit — designed for the way you work. [Join](https://turbot.com/community/join) our open-source community!

## Dashboards for DevOps

See our documentation for examples of how to use Powerpipe to [visualize cloud infrastructure](https://powerpipe.io/docs#visualize-cloud-infrastructure) and [run security and compliance benchmarks](https://powerpipe.io/docs#run-security-and-compliance-benchmarks). These examples use [mods](https://hub.powerpipe.io/?engines=steampipe) written for Steampipe and its plugin ecosystem.

Note, though, that Powerpipe is database-agnostic. We also provide samples for dashboards that use other data sources via [Postgres, SQLite, DuckDB, and MySQL](https://hub.powerpipe.io/?engines=postgres,duckdb,sqlite,mysql).
