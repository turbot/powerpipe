## Dashboards for DevOps

Use [Powerpipe](https://powerpipe.io) to visualize any data source and run compliance benchmarks and controls that enable effective decision-making and ongoing compliance monitoring.

**Dashboards and reports**. High-level dashboards provide a quick overview. Use them to highlight misconfigurations and hotspots. [Filter](https://powerpipe.io/docs/run/benchmark/benchmark-dashboard#filtering--grouping), pivot, and [snapshot](https://powerpipe.io/docs/run/snapshots) results.

**Benchmarks**. We offer [5,000+ open-source controls](https://hub.powerpipe.io) from CIS, NIST, PCI, HIPAA, FedRamp and more. [Run instantly on your machine](https://powerpipe.io/docs#run-security-and-compliance-benchmarks) or as part of your deployment pipeline.

**Relationship diagrams**. The only dashboarding tool designed from the ground up to [visualize DevOps data](https://powerpipe.io/docs#visualize-cloud-infrastructure). Explore your cloud, understand relationships, drill down to the details.

**Code, not clicks**. Our dashboards are [code](https://powerpipe.io/docs/build): version-controlled, composable, shareable, easy to edit — designed for the way you work.

## Powerpipe mods: dashboards and benchmarks

Powerpipe [mods](https://hub.powerpipe.io) are sets of pre-built dashboards that visualize your resources and benchmarks that check your cloud resources for compliance. Ready to use mods are available for [AWS](https://hub.powerpipe.io/?q=aws), [Azure](https://hub.powerpipe.io/?q=azure), [GCP](https://hub.powerpipe.io/?q=gcp), [GitHub](https://hub.powerpipe.io/?q=github), [Kubernetes](https://hub.powerpipe.io/?q=kubernetes), [Terraform](https://hub.powerpipe.io/?q=terraform), [M365](https://hub.powerpipe.io/mods/turbot/microsoft365_compliance) and much more to cover common use cases for [security & compliance](https://hub.powerpipe.io/?objectives=compliance), [cost management](https://hub.powerpipe.io/?objectives=cost), [shift-left scanning](https://hub.powerpipe.io/?categories=iac), and [asset inventory and insights](https://hub.powerpipe.io/?objectives=dashboard).

Many mods are written for Steampipe and its plugin ecosystem. But Powerpipe is database-agnostic, and we provide samples for dashboards that use other data sources via [Postgres, SQLite, DuckDB, and MySQL](https://hub.powerpipe.io/?engines=postgres,duckdb,sqlite,mysql).

## Developing

If you want to help develop the core Powerpipe binary, these are the steps to build it.

<details>
<summary>Clone</summary>

Clone [github.com/powerpipe](https://github.com/turbot/powerpipe) and [github.com/turbot/pipe-fittings](https://github.com/turbot/pipe-fittings):

```sh
git clone git@github.com:turbot/powerpipe
git clone git@github.com:turbot/pipe-fittings
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Build</summary>

```sh
cd powerpipe
make
```

The Powerpipe binary lands in `/usr/local/bin` unless you specify an alternate `OUTPUT_DIR`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Check the install</summary>

```sh
powerpipe --version

powerpipe --help
```
</details>
