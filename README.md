# Powerpipe

Powerpipe is "dashboards as code," running controls and benchmarks for compliance checks. It transforms complex data into visual, interactive dashboards, providing real-time insights for efficient decision-making and ongoing compliance monitoring, all in a streamlined, code-driven format.

**Running Controls**. Powerpipe can execute controls and benchmarks, which are predefined checks or tests against specific compliance or quality standards. This automation ensures that compliance is continually monitored and maintained.

**Real-Time Dashboards**. Powerpipe can run real-time dashboards that visually represent compliance and performance data. These dashboards provide immediate insights and allow for quick decision-making.

**Customizable and Interactive**. Each dashboard is fully customizable, catering to the specific needs and preferences of different teams or departments within an organization. The interactive nature of these dashboards allows for a deeper dive into the data, offering granular insights.
