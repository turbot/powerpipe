## v0.3.0 [2024-05-14]
_Whats new_
- Add support for installing mods from a branch or from the local file system. ([#285](https://github.com/turbot/powerpipe/issues/285))

To install from a branch:
```
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-well-architected#main
```
To reference a mod in the local file system:
```
powerpipe mod install ../mods/local_mod_folder
```

- Add `--pull` flag to `mod`, `dashboard` and `benchmark` commands to control the mod update strategy. ([#285](https://github.com/turbot/powerpipe/issues/285)). Possible update strategies are:

  - `full` - check branch and tags for both latest and accuracy
  - `latest` - update everything to latest, but only branches - not tags - are commit checked (which is the same as latest)
  - `development` - update branches and broken constraints to latest, leave satisfied constraints unchanged
  - `minimal` - only update broken constraints, do not check branches for new commits

## v0.2.0 [2024-04-26]
_Whats new_
- It is now possible to set a timeout for benchmark and dashboard execution. These can be set:
    - in the workspace using config `dashboard_timeout` and `benchmark_timeout`
    - using the `--dashboard-timeout` flag for the the `dashboard run` and `server` commands 
    - using the `--benchmark-timeout` flag for the `benchmark run` commands. 
    - using the environment variables `POWERPIPE_DASHBOARD_TIMEOUT` and `POWERPIPE_BENCHMARK_TIMEOUT` respectively.
  ([#336](https://github.com/turbot/powerpipe/issues/336))
- Support installing private mods using a github app token. ([#381](https://github.com/turbot/pipe-fittings/issues/381)).
- Improve layout of filter and grouping components for control tags and dimensions. ([#263](https://github.com/turbot/powerpipe/issues/263))
- Remove `dashboard input list` and `dashboard input show` commands.
- Add thousands separator to numeric values in dashboard tables. ([#315](https://github.com/turbot/powerpipe/issues/315))
- Only show benchmark cards for statuses that are contained in the current filter and add status to filter on card click. ([#322](https://github.com/turbot/powerpipe/issues/322))

_Bug fixes_
- When calling mod update, respect the argument (if any) and only update specified mods. ([#331](https://github.com/turbot/powerpipe/issues/331))
- Fix `mod update` display of updates to transitive dependencies. ([#288](https://github.com/turbot/powerpipe/issues/288))

## v0.1.3 [2024-03-18]
_Bug fixes_
- When exporting or displaying a check run as a snapshot, ensure the top level panel has a valid summary. ([#274](https://github.com/turbot/powerpipe/issues/274))
- Update `mod list` output to include `resource_name` and `mod` fields. 

## v0.1.2 [2024-03-15]
_Whats new_
- Optimize workspace load time for large workspaces with multiple dependent mods. ([#365](https://github.com/turbot/pipe-fittings/issues/365))
